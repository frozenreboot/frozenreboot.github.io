## 🥶 FrozenReboot?
> "Ignite the heart, Reboot the frozen world."

Hello! I am a **Robotics Engineer**.
My nickname, **FrozenReboot**, symbolizes my approach to engineering: calmly analyzing frozen(legacy/buggy) systems and successfully rebooting them into modern, robust environments.

### 🚀 What I Do
Currently, I am working in the robotics industry, focusing on:
- **Refactoring Legacy Code:** Migrating old drivers and systems to **Modern C++** and **ROS2**.
- **System Integration:** Building reliable robot software architectures using Docker and Embedded Linux.
- **Open Source:** Contributing to the robotics community by sharing drivers and tools.

### 🎯 Goals
- **Short-term:** Master the depths of C++ concurrency and ROS2 middleware.
- **Long-term:** Contributing to the global robotics ecosystem, specifically aiming for a career in **Japan's advanced robotics sector**.

### ☕ Support
If my open-source projects or blog posts helped you save time, consider buying me a coffee! It fuels my late-night coding sessions.
